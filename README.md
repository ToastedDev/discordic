# Discordic

The Discord package of your dreams.

## About

Discordic is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) module that allows you to intuitively interact with [Discord's API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro).

It allows you to create powerful bots for [Discord's ever growing platform](https://discord.com).

This repository contains multiple packages with separate [releases](https://github.com/ToastedDev/discordic/releases). You can find the assembled Discord API wrapper at [discordic](https://github.com/ToastedDev/discordic/tree/main/packages/discordic).
